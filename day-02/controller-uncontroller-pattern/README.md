## Controlled & Uncontrolled pattern

### Controlled Component

In a Controlled component, the form input value is controlled by React state. Means components state `Single source of truth` of the input values

### Uncontrolled Component

Uncontrolled components let the DOM manage their state internally. React does not directly control the
input value.
